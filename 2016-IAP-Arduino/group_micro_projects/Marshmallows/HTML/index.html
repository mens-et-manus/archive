<h2>
Project description
</h2>
<p>
We are building an Arduino-controlled turret that fires marshmallows at people/zombies/aliens/etc. Once completed, this project will have great applications, from defending our school against Caltech intruders to fighting against the First Order.
</p>

<h2>
Mechanical design
</h2>
<p>
Mindy developed a great structure out of an Amazon packaging box.

Here is how it works. The sequence below can be easily programmed into an Arduino board.
</h3>
<p>
To load
</p>
<p>
(1) Rotate the servo out of the way
</p>
<p>
(2) Pull the string with the DC motor until the movable arm is at its lowest position
</p>
<p>
(3) Rotate the servo back to jam the movable arm
</p>
<p>
(4) Rewind the DC motor to loosen the string
</p>
<p>
To fire
</p>
<p>
(5) Rotate the servo and unblock the movable arm
</p>

How to rewind a DC motor

<p>
Since it was hard to find a suitable integrated H-bridge chip, we decided to build our own H-bridge. Two relays are used as SPDT switches. The circuit diagram is shown here:

    <td>Pin 7 = HIGH, Pin 8 = HIGH</td>
    <td>Pin 7 = LOW, Pin 8 = LOW</td>

Marshmallow Headquarters on PC
</h2>
<p>
We wrote a GUI by C# that talks to the Arduino board through a serial port. Therefore, besides controlling our weapon by pushbuttons, we can also load and fire on a computer.

<h2>
More features to be expected!
</h2>
<p>
(1) Rotating turret controlled by the GUI: aim at your enemy with your mouse!
</p>
<p>
(2) Voice control: use your vocal cord as a trigger!
</p>
<p>
(3) Auto-targeting with IR sensor: nowhere to hide!
</p>
<p>
(4) Auto-loading and multiple shots per trigger: an automatic weapon!
