<h1>Project Goals</h1>
<p>The goal of our project is to create a small device along with a compatible projector that can be mounted in a car. The purpose of this is to project the GPS path of the route in order to minimize the danger associated with diverting attention to look at alerts and the path on screens. Ultimately, we want to include a setting which can digitally display the road lines and signs so that drivers can be aware of their surroundings when driving in dangerous situations.
