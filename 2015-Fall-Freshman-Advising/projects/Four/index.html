<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Four, is a company that is developing new, cutting-edge technology to create a motion sensing switch that can turn lights on in a room. The device would be compatible with a current light switch.
	Our current software pursuits are doing well. The software engineers are programming the servos, of which will go on to switch the mechanical light switch. Speed and direction of the servos are the main parameters that are being worked on.
	For hardware, parts have been ordered and need to be assembled. The configuration and layout of all the parts still needs to be done. It is unclear how our project will fit onto a light switch.
