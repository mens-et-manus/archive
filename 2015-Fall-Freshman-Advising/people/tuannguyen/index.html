<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
  Tuan was born as a nigerian farmer, whose main job was to milk the roosters and bulls. He enjoyed the job, but felt
  that he was destined for greater. Then, he was discovered for his mad curling skillz, and promptly joined the
  olympic curling team. Which one you ask? All of them. He was in all of them. He has been voted the most Asian
  person in the world. It's true. He so yellow. He's won Miss America for the last four years. He plans for Miss
  Universe next. Good luck to him, though he probably doesn't need it. He is soooooo fabulous like yaaaaas gaga.
  Anyway, he's in MIT now somehow. Admissions doesn't like to admit their mistakes?
