<i>Escape from the Zoo</i> is a mini-RPG designed in Unity and controlled with a Microsoft Kinect. 
In this game, you control four animals - Penguin, Rhino, Gecko and Frog - as they navigate the confines 
of their dilapidated zoo, find the keys the zookeeper has conspicuously left in their pens, and interact with their friends.
Each animal is controlled with Kinect gestures that mimic that animal's real movements: you can waddle as Penguin, crawl
across the floor as Gecko, jump with Frog and charge with Rhino. Fun dialogue and a colorful atmosphere create a flippant,
humorous tone to the game. <br><br>

This project was developed as part of an IAP workshop titled "Learn to Build Your Own Videogame 
with the Unity Game Engine and Microsoft Kinect," run by Kyle Keane and Mark Vrablic, in January 2017. <br><br>
