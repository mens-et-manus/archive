<h2>Process</h2>
    Helen Smith, Pramoda, Andrea

    Ideation - We want to do a 2D (or 3D?) game in which you can use parts of your body to paint on a "canvas" on the screen. We would like players to be able to change the shape, size and color of the brush.

    Process -
        - Identify which tutorials could help us - each of us looked at different ones
        - Set up a Github project folder
        - All watch the selected tutorials: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5U1ZaZ080">Unity 5: How to do a Paint Program</a>
