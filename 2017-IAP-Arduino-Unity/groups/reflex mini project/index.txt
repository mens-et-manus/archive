Reflex team: Zijun, Guillermo, Nick

We are interested in running+dodging obstacles game. Initially idea was
bridge jumping, but we finally decide to work on a kinect version of Temple
Runner.

First, we would test-proof the initial phrase: we create a cube (controlled
by a mouse) to represent the player, and simple obstacles (e.g. U shape, donut,
mailbox, tree branch).

Our immediate tasks are:

Collision
Obstacle templates
Scoring system
Sounds
Force to move obstacles
Pairing 1 joint of kinect with player, then 2 joints

Future tasks:
Pairing 2+ joints
Player can pick up runes (invulnerable, fast/slow)
Player design (a body mesh)
Kinect - body - movement - player's appearance
Background
Shielding gesture (an unavoidable obstacle)
