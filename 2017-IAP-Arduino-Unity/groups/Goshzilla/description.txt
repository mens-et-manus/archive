Goshzilla is a 3D kinect-based action game in which you, a kind, gentle and uncomfortably large monster, 
must lumber through the city with as few casualties as posssible. You control Goshzilla with your whole body:
when you move your arms and head, he moves his in the same way, and when you stomp your feet, Goshzilla moves
forward. As you walk through the city, you must contort your body to avoid the absurd modernist architecture that
plagues the downtown core; bumping into buildings will cause casualties, and if you get too many casualties the
city calls in the military and you lose.
