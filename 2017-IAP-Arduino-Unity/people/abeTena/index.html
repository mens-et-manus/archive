<p> 1/10/17 - I was able to import meshes from blender and start a level design. Blender’s positions and scale do not play well with Unity. Making a big change in blender looks small in Unity. Also, I learned you have to save your model in Object mode in blender. Otherwise, the change is not reflected. Im still curious as to why/how the hierarchy of the blender scene is reflected in Unity. I wonder if it would be better to make obj’s.” </p>

<p> 1/11/17 - Today I want to add a camera shake when Player touches the walls, and I want to change display properties for objects as the camera comes close.</p>
